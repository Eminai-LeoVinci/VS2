/**
 * Entity Model Features (EMF) compat for the helm rider's arms-on-the-wheel pose.
 *
 * <p>Eureka's stand-at-helm pose reaches the rider's arms forward by writing the VANILLA model's arm
 * parts. An EMF custom player model (Fresh Animations' "FA+Player") draws its own geometry from its
 * own parts, so those writes never reach the drawn figure -- the helmsman stood at the wheel but with
 * his arms hanging at his sides.
 *
 * <p>Posing the vanilla model earlier would not help either: FA composes each arm rotation from its
 * own idle/movement/equip terms and only folds the vanilla rotation in while an item action (block,
 * aim, brush) is running, so outside those actions the vanilla value is discarded entirely.
 *
 * <p>So pose EMF's OWN parts, at the last moment before they draw. EMF's render path is
 * {@code EMFModelPartWithState.render -> root.oneTimeRunnable(); root.animate(); super.render(...)},
 * which makes the TAIL of {@code animate()} the exact analogue of a renderToBuffer HEAD: every pack
 * expression has run, nothing has drawn yet.
 *
 * <p>Whether the rider is standing at a mount is derived from the state's ENTITY (1.21.11 reads a
 * flag its render-state architecture carries; 1.21.1 has no render states): any
 * {@link ShipMountingEntity} vehicle that is not a reconnect passenger seat is a station being
 * stood at, the same condition the vanilla-side pose uses.
 *
 * <p>Parts are resolved by CEM name through the whole hierarchy rather than as direct children
 * (via {@link ModelPartAccessor}; 1.21.1 has no {@code createPartLookup}), so this holds however a
 * pack nests its rig, and each name is optional -- the same injector serves the player model (arms +
 * the skin's sleeve overlay) and any armour model, and simply finds nothing on a cape or elytra.
 * The first-person hand is left alone, matching vanilla, where that path renders the arm directly
 * rather than through the model.
 *
 * <p>String target + no EMF types in the mixin's own signature on purpose: a string target makes
 * this a soft mixin that no-ops when EMF is not installed.
