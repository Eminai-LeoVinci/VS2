/**
 * The D-pad, read straight off the hardware.
 *
 * Controller mods deliver buttons by emulating keybinds, and that delivery is theirs to arbitrate -- a
 * button that already carries one of their own actions may never reach a modded binding at all. The ship
 * controls that OWN a context (the wheel's zoom and altitude, Eureka's crouch layer) want the button
 * itself, unconditionally, so this polls GLFW's gamepad state directly: no keybind, no emulation, no
 * arbitration. GLFW ships the SDL controller database, so anything it recognises as a gamepad -- Switch
 * Pro pads included -- reports the same standard D-pad regardless of make.
 *
 * [poll] runs once at the START of each client tick (the platform hook), before every reader: the
 * mounted D-pad handling, the driving packet's ascend/descend, and any downstream mod's layer. Readers
 * elsewhere in the tick see one coherent frame of state; a reader whose hook happens to run before the
 * poll sees last tick's, which costs an edge one tick of latency and nothing else. Main thread only, as
 * all GLFW input calls are.
