/**
 * Makes the influence-border faces (Front / Back / Left / Right) follow each ship's HELM instead of the
 * raw ship-space axes.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * The per-face influence-border extension ([org.valkyrienskies.mod.common.config.VSClientConfig]) stores six
 * values named Top/Bottom/Left/Right/Front/Back. A naive implementation pins those names to fixed ship-space
 * axes (`+Z = Front`, `-X = Left`, ...). But a ship's forward direction *in ship space* is whatever the helm
 * happened to face when the ship was assembled -- assemble the same raft facing east vs. north and its
 * ship-space forward axis differs by 90 degrees. So a fixed name->axis mapping is only ever correct for ships
 * built in one particular orientation; on every other ship the "Front" command visibly grows a side face, etc.
 * (Re-assembling doesn't help -- it just re-freezes ship space to the same world axes.)
 *
 * ## What it does instead
 * We learn each ship's forward horizontal [Direction] in ship space (see [observeForward]) and rotate the
 * Front/Back/Left/Right values onto the ship's actual faces at read time ([horizontalExtents]). Forward is the
 * helm-thrust direction -- `seat.direction.opposite`, the same value Eureka feeds into
 * `SeatedControllingPlayer.seatInDirection` -- so the border matches the universal helm convention (wheel/player
 * side is the stern, the helm's back faces the bow). Top/Bottom stay pinned to +-Y (gravity is unambiguous).
 *
 * The forward is seeded at ASSEMBLY (Eureka's helm reflectively calls [observeForward] with the helm's facing the
 * instant the ship is built) and, as a refresh, every tick a player is seated at the helm. It is never cleared,
 * so a parked ship keeps its heading. Until a ship has ever been seeded, [forwardFor] falls back to
 * [Direction.SOUTH] (`+Z`), i.e. the plain ship-space default.
 *
 * In single-player the integrated server (the carry in [EntityDragger]) and the client (the wireframe in
 * ShipInfluenceBorderRenderer) share this one singleton, so both read the same learned heading.
