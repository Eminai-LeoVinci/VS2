/**
 * The walk an unemployed villager makes toward a workstation it wants, when that workstation is aboard a ship.
 *
 * <p>{@code tick} re-issues the walk-and-look target at the potential job site's position every single tick,
 * and it was issuing the raw shipyard position. That this ever worked at all was an accident of another
 * mixin: {@code MoveToTargetSink.reachedTarget} is ship-translated, so a villager who happened to already be
 * standing at the workstation's WORLD position counted as arrived and took the job -- while one a deck-length
 * away pathed toward the shipyard, failed, and burned its twelve-hundred-tick timeout. Translating the
 * position here makes the approach an actual approach.
 *
 * <p>{@code tick} is overloaded (the generic {@code Behavior} bridge takes {@code LivingEntity}); the
 * descriptor pins the villager one, which is where the position is read.
