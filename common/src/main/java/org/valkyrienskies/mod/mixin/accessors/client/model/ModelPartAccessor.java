 * Named access to a part's children. Vanilla 1.21.1 exposes {@code getAllParts()} (no names) and
 * {@code getChild(name)} (throws on a miss, direct children only); the EMF arms-at-helm pose needs to
 * resolve parts BY NAME through the whole hierarchy, which later versions serve with
 * {@code createPartLookup()} -- absent here, so the map itself is opened instead.
