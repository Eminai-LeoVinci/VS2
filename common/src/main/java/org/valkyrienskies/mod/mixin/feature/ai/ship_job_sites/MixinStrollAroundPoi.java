/**
 * The wander that keeps a working villager alive-looking, for a job site aboard a ship.
 *
 * <p>During work hours this is what scatters a villager around its workstation -- an eight-block hop every
 * couple hundred ticks. It only runs while the villager is already NEAR the site, and that gate compared the
 * job site's raw shipyard position against the villager's world position, which aboard a ship is never within
 * anything. So the gate never opened, the villager never strolled, and a crew stood frozen wherever the
 * approach had dropped them -- which is on the workstation itself. This, not any pull toward the helm, is the
 * pile-up: the pull behaviours were translated long ago, and what remained untranslated was precisely the set
 * of behaviours whose whole job is to disperse the crowd again.
 *
 * <p>Patched at the source like {@link MixinSetWalkTargetFromBlockMemory}: everything positional in the
 * trigger derives from {@code GlobalPos.pos()} (here it is only the gate -- the wander target itself is
 * mob-relative), so one conversion covers the method however it evolves.
