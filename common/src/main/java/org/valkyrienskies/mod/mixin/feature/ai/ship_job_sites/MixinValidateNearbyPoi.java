/**
 * "Is my job site still there?" -- which vanilla only asks once the mob is NEAR it.
 *
 * <p>The proximity gate is the same cross-space comparison as {@code WorkAtPoi}'s, and getting it wrong has a
 * nastier consequence than merely not working: a villager that is never "near" its job site is never told the
 * job site has gone, so the memory is never erased, {@code LoseJobOnSiteLoss} never fires, and the profession
 * sticks forever. That is why a Crewman kept its coat after its wheel had been broken.
 *
 * <p><b>Only the distance test is translated, deliberately.</b> This behaviour also asks the POI index whether
 * a record still exists at that position, and the index is keyed by the REAL block position -- which for a
 * workstation aboard a ship is the shipyard one. Translating the lookup too would ask about a position the
 * index has never heard of and delete every job site on every ship.
 *
 * <p>The target is a lambda, so it carries an intermediary name rather than a readable one; the enclosing
 * method is {@code ValidateNearbyPoi.create}'s trigger body.
