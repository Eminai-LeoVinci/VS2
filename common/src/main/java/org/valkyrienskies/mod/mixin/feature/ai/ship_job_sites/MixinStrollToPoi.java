/**
 * The periodic visit to the workstation itself, for a job site aboard a ship.
 *
 * <p>This is the fine half of vanilla's work rhythm: where {@link net.minecraft.world.entity.ai.behavior
 * .SetWalkTargetFromBlockMemory} only reels a villager to within nine blocks, this one walks them right up to
 * the block every eighty-odd ticks, which is what makes a librarian actually stand at the lectern. Its
 * proximity gate AND its walk target both read the raw shipyard position, so aboard a ship the gate never
 * opened -- one more of the frozen-crew behaviours -- and had it somehow fired, the walk target would have
 * pointed at the shipyard.
 *
 * <p>One conversion at {@code GlobalPos.pos()} fixes both reads at once, the same source-patch shape as
 * {@link MixinSetWalkTargetFromBlockMemory}.
