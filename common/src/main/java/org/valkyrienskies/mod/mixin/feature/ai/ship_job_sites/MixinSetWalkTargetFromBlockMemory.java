/**
 * Where to actually walk, for a job site aboard a ship.
 *
 * <p>This is the behaviour that turns a JOB_SITE memory into a {@link net.minecraft.world.entity.ai.memory
 * .WalkTarget}, and it was handing the pathfinder a raw shipyard coordinate. The mob then set off toward a
 * point millions of blocks away, failed, re-targeted and set off again -- the relentless walking that made a
 * helm look like it had a gravity well.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the other two goals, this one is patched at the SOURCE rather than at each comparison. Every use of
 * the position in here derives from {@code GlobalPos.pos()} -- the two distance gates and both flavours of walk
 * target -- and nothing in this method consults the POI index, so converting once at the top is both smaller
 * and harder to get half-right than wrapping four call sites individually.
 *
 * <p>The target is a lambda and so carries an intermediary name; it is the trigger body of
 * {@code SetWalkTargetFromBlockMemory.create}.
