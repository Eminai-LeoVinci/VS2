/**
 * Where a job site actually IS, for a mob standing in the world.
 *
 * <p>A workstation aboard an assembled ship lives at shipyard coordinates -- millions of blocks from where the
 * hull is drawn -- while the villager standing in front of it is at ordinary world coordinates. {@code
 * MixinPOIManager} already teaches the POI SEARCHES to compare the two properly, so a villager finds and claims
 * a workstation on a ship. What it stores is the record's raw position, and every goal that then consumes that
 * memory compares it against the villager's world position directly.
 *
 * <p>That is the "further mixins to Goals" the original author flagged and never wrote, and its symptom was a
 * wheel with a gravity well round it: villagers set off for a helm twenty-eight million blocks away, gave up,
 * re-targeted, and set off again, forever -- while never being close enough for {@code WorkAtPoi} to fire or
 * for {@code ValidateNearbyPoi} to release them.
 *
 * <p>This is the one conversion those goals need. It is deliberately a no-op for anything not in the shipyard,
 * so a workstation on land costs one cheap coordinate test and behaves exactly as vanilla.
